# Tictactoe

## The goal of the game is for players(depending upon the user's choice: pvp or cvp) to position their marks("X" and "O" respectively) so that they make a continuous line of three cells vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. An opponent can prevent a win by blocking the completion of the opponent's line. If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is considered a Tie.

## According to the code:
  First a menu is given,

->from there we can choose Auto mode or Manual mode.

->In auto mode the user will give his/her name.

->Player is assigned "X" and computer "O".

->Then the user only needs to enter the number where he wants to mark his assigned symbol.

->The user has to type "mark" so that random input is given for computers turn.

->In manual mode, both the users are supposed to input their names first player gets "X" and second player gets "O".

->Both play in turns and result will be declared at the end.
